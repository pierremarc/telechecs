# Téléchecs

Play on [Lichess](https://lichess.org/) over the board, for cheap.

You can try it on https://pierremarc.github.io/telechecs/

### An experiment

I find playing online an exciting idea but a very frustrating experience. Being glued to a screen lowers the enjoyment of playing quite a bit, and unfortunately I couldn't manage to focus my attention when I replicated the game online on a chessboard. Thus the idea to have the online part reduced to a scoresheet as to not distract me from the board. After having the interface quite OK plugged to a chess engine, it's now redirected to the great [Lichess](https://lichess.org/) platform.

The state of the application is at the level of a proof of concept, but already functional enough to make it enjoyable to play with.

Made a lil video to demonstrate how it's supposed to work.
